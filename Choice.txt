Choice


I have chosen the way to build the web application with Google App Engine.

I think that this is the most accessible way to create the web aplication. I have used at my work an html page that I have created for my Kodilla Bootcam in Data Science

There re also the disadvantages of Google App Engine:

CPU-intensive operations in GAE are slow and expensive to perform because one physical server may be serving several discreet, unrelated app engine users at once who need to share the CPU.

I have tried to deploy kubernates and I have managed the create the cluster but I had some difficulties to finish the task.

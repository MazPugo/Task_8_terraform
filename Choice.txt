Bringing it all together


﻿Goal of the task
The goal is to apply all the knowledge we gathered along the way to deploy a simple website! There is also a bonus task that goes a bit beyond what we’ve learned.
Tips for task 8:

I think that this is the most accessible and the most easiest way to create the web aplication. 

I have used at my project an html file and css file that I have created 
for a project at Kodilla Bootcam in Data Science

I have tried to deploy kubernates and I have managed the create the cluster but I had some difficulties to finish the task.
